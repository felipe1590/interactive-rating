## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Having defined the design in this way, I created a class responsible for hiding the first page containing the class. As soon as a note was selected, I used a variable to assign the value and call it on the final screen.

```html
<section id="final-rating" class="displayOff">
  <img src="images/illustration-thank-you.svg" />
  <p id="rating">You selected 0 out of 5</p>
  <h2>Thank you!</h2>
  <p>
    We appreciate you taking the time to give a rating. If you ever need more
    support, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch!
  </p>
</section>
```

```css
.displayOff {
  display: none;
}
```

```js
btnSubmit.addEventListener("click", () => {
  finalRating(btnAtivo);
});

function finalRating(rating) {
  if (rating !== 0) {
    page1.classList.add("displayOff");
    page2.classList.remove("displayOff");

    ratingFinal.textContent = `You selected ${btnAtivo} out of 5`;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'm focusing on improving my JavaScript skills to get better with React.js and become a better programmer, developing my knowledge in a structured way and focusing on the applied study of the front-end.

### Useful resources

- [Front-end with React](https://ada.tech/) - He helped me by giving me the basics of the whole JavaScript context and introducing me to React.js to start being a front-end programmer.
